### Hi! I'm Jess. 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in astronomy at the University of Victoria in BC, Canada. My research is focused on understanding how exoplanets form, and how we can detect them while they are still being born. I work with observations from the ALMA radio telescope, and I often perform computational simulations to help interpret the observations.
